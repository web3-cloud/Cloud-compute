Introduction
</br>

Cloud computing has revolutionized the way we deploy and manage our applications and services. With the rise of cloud computing, there has also been an increasing demand for secure and reliable hypervisors that can manage multiple virtual machines on a single physical server.

However, traditional hypervisor deployment methods have several drawbacks, including limited fault tolerance, scalability challenges, and security risks. In this paper, we propose a method for standing up a cloud compute hypervisor on a blockchain network, leveraging the immutability and decentralized nature of blockchain to ensure the security and reliability of the hypervisor.

Architecture
</br>

The proposed architecture involves deploying a blockchain network that supports smart contracts. The smart contract will define the rules for creating and managing the hypervisor instances, as well as managing the permissions for accessing and managing the instances.

To join the hypervisor network, nodes must participate in the blockchain consensus algorithm to prove their authenticity and ensure the integrity of the network. This includes the control plane nodes, which are responsible for managing the overall state of the hypervisor instances. Once a node has been accepted into the network, it can participate in the deployment and management of the hypervisor instances.

The consensus algorithm used in the proposed solution can be either proof of stake or proof of work, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the deployment. In both cases, the algorithm ensures that only valid nodes are allowed to participate in the network, and that all nodes agree on the current state of the hypervisor instances.

Benefits
</br>

The proposed solution provides several benefits over traditional hypervisor deployment methods. These include:

Increased security: By leveraging the immutability and decentralized nature of blockchain, the hypervisor instances are more resistant to attacks and tampering.

Fault tolerance: The hypervisor instances can be easily distributed across multiple nodes, allowing for increased availability and fault tolerance.

Scalability: The use of blockchain allows for better management of resources and more efficient scaling.
